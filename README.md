## Compatibility

This mod was last tested using [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) 3.5.0 and Stardew Valley 1.4.5 from Steam on openSUSE Tumbleweed Linux (Kernel 5.6.8-1-default) in May 2020.

## Performance 

This mod performs performance logging.
The time it takes to sort a chest (with up to 36 stacks) seems to always be in the 0.5â€“5.0 ms range.
Also, the first time a chest is sorted in a play session is usually slower than it would normally be.
This is likely due to the dynamic loading of some of the code associated with the mod.
Cases that, as of version 1.0.0, require items to be compared based on some of the parts of their names are particularly slow.
